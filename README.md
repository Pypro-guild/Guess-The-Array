# Guess-The-Array
Game prepared for PMACS TASK 1 - Probability investigation.

This game has been designed for the 25th anniversary of PMACS, and to celerbate the event many individuals have created games (not reliant on programming) to entertain others during this festivity. The game's idea sprouted when I thought about pseudo-random number generators and chance, hence I created a game not only revolving against simple probability, but a random kick to it. 

This game can be repurposed and is open source, so please feel free to edit to your heart's content. If you wish to understand the code, comments have been included in the base game's code. It does require some understanding of for loops, pseudo-random seed and mathematical functions in C++, however I have tried to water it down for readers. 

Happy 25th PMACS anniversary!
